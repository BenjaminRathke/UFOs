## Overview of UFO Sightings with JavaScript
A journalist would like to publish her article on UFOs on an easy-to-use, dynamic HTML page, with a table of UFO data that the end-user can filter based on several different parameters to "decide for themselves," if UFOs really are out there...

## UFO Sightings with JavaScript
One drawback of this webpage is that syntax must be exact.  For example, typing "CA" will return no information, but "ca" will return all California sightings.
In addition to allowing for a more relaxed syntax, I would add a full "reset" or "clear" button for all filters that would also return the full table.  Since there appear to be a relatively small number of different states, dates, and shapes, I would recommend drop-down menus to search some of these filters and fields to avoid errors with syntax.
